how 2-way data-binding happening in NG ?

for every model property , 
angular internally register 'watcher' functions
'watcher' function ==> read/write model when it is dirty.


all watchers are executed by 'digest-loop'



we can also register custom-watchers , to know model changes

provider  with factory method   ==> service-objs
